For each of them, there are two functions, with or without lubrication correction. For mobility problem, also fixed particles can be handled.\r\n\r\n### about RYUON project\r\n[libstokes](http://kichiki.github.com/ryuon/libstokes/) is a part of [RYUON project](http://kichiki.github.com/ryuon/).\r\n\r\nFor details about libstokes, go to \"[libstokes](http://kichiki.github.com/ryuon/libstokes/)\"\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nKengo Ichiki (@kichiki)\r\n\r\n### License\r\n[libstokes](http://kichiki.github.com/ryuon/libstokes/) is released under [GNU General Public License, version 2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
